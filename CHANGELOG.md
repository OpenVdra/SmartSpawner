# Changelog

All notable changes to SmartSpawner are documented in this file.

## 1.7.0.2

### Fixed
- Fixed a crash that could happen when breaking a vanilla spawner that had no mob type set. This no longer throws an error and the spawner now breaks normally.
- Fixed an error that could appear in the console when a Bedrock player (via Floodgate/Geyser) opened a spawner menu or storage on Folia based servers. Menus now open reliably for these players.
- Removed the "Server Version Not Supported" warning message. It was showing up incorrectly on newer supported server versions and is no longer needed.
- Update notifications will no longer mention SmartSpawner2 versions (2.0.0 and above). SmartSpawner2 is a separate product, so 1.x servers will only be notified about relevant 1.x updates.

### Added
- Re-added RedProtect support. Spawners inside RedProtect regions now respect region permissions again when opening menus or stacking spawners.

### Notes
- This is a maintenance release focused on stability. No configuration changes are required to update.
